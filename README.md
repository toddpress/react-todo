# Making React Context FAST! - without context?

A simple todo app using custom hook(s) and selectors for state mgmt via useSyncExternalStore. Inspired by [@jherr](https://github.com/jherr)'s [video on context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKlXqrcBx88), only I didn't use context... I may be overlooking something but the context did not seem needed.
